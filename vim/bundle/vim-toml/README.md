# vim-toml

Vim syntax for [TOML](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml). May be somewhat buggy -- it's my first attempt at a
vim syntax file.

This was developed for the following TOML revision:
[a0a444da](https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/commit/a0a444da136bfc788923dbe3983c18321667dc5d).

## Installation

### Pathogen

Set up [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) then clone/submodule this repo into `~/.vim/bundle/toml`, or wherever you've pointed your Pathogen.

### Vundle

Set up [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) then add `Bundle 'cespare/vim-toml'` to your vimrc and run `:BundleInstall` from a fresh vim.
