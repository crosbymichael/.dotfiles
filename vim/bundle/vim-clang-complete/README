This plugin uses clang for accurately completing C and C++ code.

To build and install in one step, type:
$ make install

To build and install in two steps, type:
$ make
$ vim clang_complete.vmb -c 'so %' -c 'q'

Alternatively, you can also put the files in ~/.vim/

You need Vim 7.3 or higher, compiled with python support and ideally, with
the conceal feature.

See doc/clang_complete.txt for help and license.

#### Troubleshooting

The first step is to check values of 'omnifunc' and 'completefunc' options in
a C++ buffer where completion doesn't work (the value should be ClangComplete).
This can be done with the following command: set omnifunc? completefunc?

Output of :messages command after startup could also show something useful in
case there were problems with plugin initialization.

If everything is fine, next step might be to load only clang_complete plugin
and see if anything changes.
