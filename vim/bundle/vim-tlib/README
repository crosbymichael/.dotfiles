This library provides some utility functions. There isn't much need to 
install it unless another plugin requires you to do so.

Most of the library is included in autoload files. No autocommands are 
created. With the exception of loading ../plugin/02tlib.vim at startup 
the library has no impact on startup time or anything else.

The change-log is included at the bottom of ../plugin/02tlib.vim
(move the cursor over the file name and type gfG)
